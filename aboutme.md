I am Yue Pan, currently Master student of Statistics in Rice University. This blog is beginning to summarize what I have explored for my summer's projects, including introduction of basic NLP techniques and their implementations. Also I am trying to continue exploring nlp when I finished the summary. I am looking for full-time jobs of Data Science.
